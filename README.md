## Tristan Norman - (SSD Student)

## Welcome to my Github Pages site!

As of right now, my main intention with this GitHub Account is to work on the projects/assignments given to me during my time in Waterford Institute of Technology (WIT). As of right now, I am finishing up my 2nd year and working on my remaining few assignments and tests.

<u>Below I will list a couple of programming languages I have some experience with:</u>

- Java
- Kotlin
- Javascript
- HTML
- CSS
- SQL




<u>Some of the projects I have made in my freetime include:</u>

1.<u> **Banking Application**</u> <br>
 Made with 'MD5#' encryption. While I am aware that using this encryption algorithim is considered to be dangerous due to it's vulnerabilities, I used it to learn about the 'java.security' package in the Java programming language. It also taught me about using a 'salt' to add extra ciphertext to an individuals banking details to assure that a hacker or any other bad actor cannot easily infiltrate sensitive information.

2.<u>**Text-Based Adventure Games**</u> <br>
Making minigames like these has taught me a lot about keeping track of user input data. For example, if a user progresses to a different sector of your game, you will need to carry over information such as, their health, points and certain playstyle conditions in order to keep the game fun and consistent. A lot of game development requires speedy and logical descision-making too; Sometimes I'd have so many, 'if' statements that it would start to become cumbersome to read through the source code - not to mention that 'if' statements are very CPU intensive and not as memory efficient as a 'switch' statement. 'Switch' statements jump to the correct case in memory unlike an 'if' statement making it faster and more ereliable to use in the case of many decisions being made at once. **<u>This is all theory I've learned through trial and error.**</u>

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/TNorman6252/TNorman6252.github.io/settings/pages). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
