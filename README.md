## Tristan Norman - (SSD Student)

## Welcome to my Github Pages site!

As of right now, my main intention with this GitHub Account is to work on the projects/assignments given to me during my time in Waterford Institute of Technology (WIT). As of right now, I am finishing up my 2nd year and working on my remaining few assignments and tests.

<u>Below I will list a couple of programming languages I have some experience with:</u>

- Java
- Kotlin
- Javascript
- HTML
- CSS
- SQL




</u>Some of the projects I have made in my freetime include:</u>

1.**Banking Application** <br>
 Made with 'MD5#' encryption. While I am aware that using this encryption algorithim is considered to be dangerous due to it's vulnerabilities, I used it to learn about the 'java.security' package in the Java programming language. It also taught me about using a 'salt' to add extra ciphertext to an individuals banking details to assure that a hacker or any other bad actor cannot easily infiltrate sensitive information.

**Text-Based Adventure Games** <br>
Making minigames like these has taught me a lot about keeping track of user input data. For example, if a user progresses to a different sector of your game, you will need to carry over information such as, their health, points and certain playstyle conditions in order to keep the game fun and consistent. A lot of game development requires speedy and logical descision-making too; Sometimes I'd have so many, 'if' statements that it would start to become cumbersome to read through the source code - not to mention that 'if' statements are very CPU intensive and not as memory efficient as a 'switch' statement. 'Switch' statements jump to the correct case in memory unlike an 'if' statement making it faster and more reliable to use in the case of many decisions being made at once. **This is all theory I've learned through trial and error.**

**Calendar Program** <br>
An interesting program that I made last year was a calendar program. It uses a few of Java's built-in classes and packages to retrieve the current date and time. However, I had to use a class called 'SimpleDateFormatter' to go with it in order to make the appearance of the date and time look normal for the typical user. I used JavaFX with a JFrame so that the user could see what the date and time were in a graphical user interface (GUI). An important detail I added was that the time updated every second live onscreen; I did this by using a 'while loop' and constantly retrieving the date and time all while updating the JLabels, etc... This particular project taught me a great deal about the use of loops and UI presentation.

**Current Project I am working on:** Quiz Application <br>
I'm working on this console application as my final project/assignment for Year 2 in the Mobile App Dev module. It features CRUD and a slew of other "nice to have" and other essential features. Currently, the project is a work in progress but it's slowly coming along and is a fun experience where I can learn new things and develop my problem solving skills - which is a key attribute to have as a developer.
