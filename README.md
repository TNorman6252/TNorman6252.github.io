## Tristan Norman - (SSD Student)

##Welcome to my Github Pages site!

As of right now, my main intention with this GitHub Account is to work on the projects/assignments given to me during my time in Waterford Institute of Technology (WIT). As of right now, I am finishing up my 2nd year and working on my remaining few assignments and tests.

Below I will list a couple of programming languages I have some experience with:

- Java
- Kotlin
- Javascript
- HTML
- CSS
- SQL


### Markdown

```markdown
Syntax highlighted code block

2. List

**Bold** and _Italic_ and `Code` text

[Link](url) and ![Image](src)
```

For more details see [Basic writing and formatting syntax](https://docs.github.com/en/github/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax).

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/TNorman6252/TNorman6252.github.io/settings/pages). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
